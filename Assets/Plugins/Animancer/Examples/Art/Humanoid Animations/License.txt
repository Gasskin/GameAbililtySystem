// Humanoid Animations //
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

These animations come from the Huge FBX Mocap Library:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/huge-fbx-mocap-library-part-1-19991

Which was ported to Unity from the Carnegie-Mellon
University mocap library: http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/

No specific license is listed, however:
"How can I use this data?
The motion capture data may be copied, modified, or redistributed without permission."
From the FAQ: http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/faqs.php

These animations have all been manually edited in Unity
to reduce jitter and to suit the needs of the example scenes.
Their file names all start with "Humanoid-".
