Mecanim Example Scenes by Unity Technologies:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/mecanim-example-scenes-5328

The model was originally called "mine_bot".

The license applied to these assets is unclear:
- No licensing details were included in the package or store page.
- They have been used in other assets such as the A* Pathfinding Project:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/ai/a-pathfinding-project-pro-87744
- However, Unity intended them as examples so they tend to discourage people from using them in games.

The model and animations have been altered for use in Animancer:
- Cleaned up the naming convention for bones, meshes, etc.
- Added foot bones for each leg so it can support Two Bone IK.
